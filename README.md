# JavaScript Interview and Coding Challenges

This repository contains JavaScript coding examples, interview questions, and solutions. The goal is to help prepare for JavaScript-related technical interviews by practicing coding challenges and understanding basic concepts.

## Topics Covered

### 1. `call`, `apply`, and `bind` Methods
- **Description**: Explanation and examples of `call`, `apply`, and `bind` methods in JavaScript.
- **Usage**: Demonstrates how to change the context (`this`) of a function using these methods.

### 2. Count Character Occurrences
- **Description**: A function to count the number of occurrences of each character in a string.
- **Use Case**: Useful for string manipulation questions in interviews.

### 3. Currying in JavaScript
- **Description**: Explanation of currying, a functional programming technique where a function is transformed into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument.
- **Example**: Practical examples showing how currying can be used to break down functions into smaller, reusable ones.

### 4. Find Duplicate Number in an Array
- **Description**: A solution to find duplicate numbers in an array.
- **Example**: Covers different methods of finding duplicates, such as using sets and hash maps.

### 5. Find Factorial of a Number
- **Description**: A function to compute the factorial of a given number using recursion and iteration.
- **Example**: Includes optimized solutions for factorial calculations.

### 6. Find Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)
- **Description**: A function to compute the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
- **Example**: Shows how to use recursion to find the GCD efficiently.

### 7. Find Max and Min Value in an Array
- **Description**: A function to find both the maximum and minimum values in an array.
- **Example**: Covers multiple approaches, including sorting and using array methods.

### 8. Find Missing Value in an Array
- **Description**: Solutions for finding the missing value in an arithmetic progression (AP) array.
- **Example**: Uses mathematical formulas and loops to solve the problem.

### 9. Find Peak Element
- **Description**: A function to find the peak element (an element that is greater than its neighbors) in an array.
- **Example**: Demonstrates how to use binary search for optimal performance.

### 10. Find Sum of Elements in an Array
- **Description**: A function to calculate the sum of all elements in an array.
- **Example**: Uses array methods like `reduce` for summing values.

### 11. Reverse an Array
- **Description**: A function to reverse the elements in an array.
- **Example**: Covers both in-place and array copying techniques.

### 12. Sort Array
- **Description**: Solutions for sorting an array using different algorithms like quicksort, mergesort, and native JavaScript methods.
- **Example**: Highlights the time complexity of various sorting methods.

### 13. String Questions
- **Description**: Various string manipulation questions, including reversing a string, checking for palindromes, and more.
- **Example**: Includes multiple techniques for solving common string problems.

### 14. Map, Reduce, and Filter Methods
- **Description**: Explanation and coding examples of JavaScriptâ€™s array methods: `map`, `reduce`, and `filter`.
- **Usage**: Shows how to use these methods for functional programming.

### 15. Find Longest String in an Array
- **Description**: A solution to find the longest string in an array.
- **Example**: Demonstrates how to iterate over an array to find the longest string efficiently.

### 16. Generate Fibonacci Sequence
- **Description**: Functions to generate Fibonacci numbers using both recursion and iteration.
- **Example**: Includes optimized approaches for generating large Fibonacci sequences.

### 17. Prime Number Checker
- **Description**: A function to check whether a given number is prime.
- **Example**: Includes optimized solutions for large numbers, using trial division and efficient loop bounds.

### 18. Undefined vs Not Defined
- **Description**: Explanation of the difference between `undefined` and variables that are not defined in JavaScript.
- **Example**: Clarifies common interview questions about these terms.
